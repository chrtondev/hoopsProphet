## Proof of Concept

This repo contains a proof of concept (POC) for predicting NBA championship chances. It serves as a preliminary exploration before developing a larger scale project.

### Purpose

The purpose of this POC is to:

1. Making a Log and Lin Regression model with small set of data
2. Test initial algorithms and data sources
3. Identify potential challenges and areas for improvement
4. Gather feedback for future development

### Note

This is not a final product. Features are limited, and predictions may not be optimized.
